lunch.js is a Node.js application that provides a REST interface for deciding where to go to lunch.

Current functionality is limited to listing users (of which none can be added), listing nominations, and nominating restaurants.

All requests respond to .json, .txt, or the default, .html.

 - List users: GET /users
 - List nominations: GET /nominations
 - Nominate a restauran: POST /nominate ?nomination

Coming soon: lun.sh!
